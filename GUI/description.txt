# Blubber documentation

Blubber is distributed in the hope that it will be a useful tool for scientists to manage their resources by gaining
some insight into the survival chances of the rescued animals.

The intended use of Blubber is for guidance only. It is not guaranteed that the predictions are 100% accurate and
therefore should not be used as a substitute for the actual survival chances of the animals.

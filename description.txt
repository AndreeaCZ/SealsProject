# Blubber documentation

Blubber is distributed in the hope that it will be a useful tool for scientists to manage their resources by gaining
some insight into the survival chances of the rescued animals.

The intended use of Blubber is for guidance only. It is not guaranteed that the predictions are 100% accurate and
therefore should not be used as a substitute for the actual survival chances of the animals.

## How to predict the survival chances of a new seal using Blubber

In order to predict the survival chances of a new seal, the user must first select the Prediction page.

On the new widow, the user must select the species of the seal and the sex of the seal using the dropdown menus.
Next select which prediction model you would like to use: click on Default model to use the model that comes with the app,
or choose to Load a model if you wish to use a model that was previously saved.
Next, input the values of the blood test results of the new seal and click on the "Predict" button to make the prediction.
Alternatively, you can use the "Import" button to import the Excel file containing the blood test results of the new seal.

If the prediction was successful, the user will be shown the survival chances of the new seal.
The user can also click on the "Save" button to save the prediction.

&nbsp;
## How to query the seal database

It is not required to fill all the available fields on that page. Simply fill the desired values and additional fields,
then enter a file name and press 'Get the subsets'. The database entries which match the criteria selected will be entered
into a new Excel file and saved with the given name.

&nbsp;
## How to train a new model for Blubber

To create a new model, the user must first select the Train a model page.

There, the user must select the parameters on which the model will be trained. Once the parameters are selected,
click the "Train" button. The window will then show the accuracy of the new model, as well as the feature importance
and the confusion matrix. If satisfactory, the user can save the model by clicking the "Save" button after inputting a
name for the new model.

&nbsp;
## How to add a new seal to the database

Adding a new seal to the database is done by clicking on the "Add a seal" button on the main page. There, the process
is similar to the process of making a prediction. Select the seal's sex, species and release status, then enter
the ID tag. Next, click on Add seal and select the Excel file which contains the seals blood test results. The seal information
will then be added to the database.

&nbsp;
## How to get the information of a seal from the database

To retrieve a seal from the database, the user must first click on the "Get a seal" button on the main page.

There, the user can input the unique ID of the seal to be retrieved. The information of the seal will
then be shown on the screen.

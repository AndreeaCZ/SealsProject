**Blubber Setup Guide**

**Getting started**
Getting the Blubber app ready for use can be done in just a few easy steps.
To start, open the folder called Blubber that comes along with this guide. Inside, you will find lots of files and folders. Among those is a file called Blubber.exe. Simply click on that file and the app will start.

**Creating a shortcut**
Having to look through a big folder in order to run Blubber up is not optimal. In order to make the process easier, it is recommended to create a shortcut to the Blubber.exe file, and place the shortcut wherever it is desired (for example the Desktop).

To do this, first locate the Blubber.exe file. Then, right click on it and select Create shortcut. A shortcut will be created and will appear in the folder. You can now move the shortcut to any location on the PC. Clicking the shortcut will start the Blubber application.

**Precautions**
While the application is running a terminal window will also open. Make sure to not close the terminal window, as closing it will cause the application to close as well. The terminal window will close on its own when you close the Blubber application.
